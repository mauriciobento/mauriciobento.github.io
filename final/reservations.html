                <ul>
                    <li><p>Level 1: the boat passes through areas with small stones, which requires little or no maneuver.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Level 2: in slightly more agitated waters, presenting a little stones along the river, it requires a
                        little maneuver. Still accepting freshmen in extreme sports.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Level 3: this level has ripples and maybe a small waterfall. More significant maneuvers are needed here.
                        The risk is greater.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Level 4: with medium waves, this level involves more elaborate maneuvers and contains large falls and few stones.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Level 5: stage with waves, rocks and large falls. Because it has greater risks, it needs a lot of cunning, precision and skill</p></li>
                    <li><p>Level 6: stage with dangerous rapids with the presence of rocks and large waves. Because there is a lot
                        of friction with the water it is possible to damage the boat.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Level 7: this is the riskiest level. To practice this path, a lot of knowledge of the techniques and
                        greater skill is required, as serious injuries can happen to practitioners, which can even lead to death.</p></li>

                    <h2>After all, is it safe to go rafting?</h2>
                    <p>Rafting is safe, but activities in nature involve risks. So, preventing yourself in all the
                        oriented ways the tour can be incredible and without any problem!</p>
                    <p>It is important to look for renowned companies with more time in the market. Note that the instructors
                        are experienced and well-known. Many are professional practitioners of the sport and are part of
                        competition teams and have already won medals.</p>
                    <p>During the descent, according to the level of the river, games are played with the personnel on board,
                        such as surfing, slides and bathing in the waters of the rivers. Hence we can see that the sport has
                        the option of being lighter and more relaxed.</p>
                    <p>The choice to venture more radically is yours. So, the sport is safe and can be enjoyed with more or less risk!</p>
