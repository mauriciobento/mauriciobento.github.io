                <h2>We have the best equipment.</h2>
                <p>Whitewater is a sport that takes a lot of adrenaline with you. After all, we are
                    talking about going down rapids from a river. And for that, you need strong current, boats, remotes,
                    safety equipment, as well as rocks and trees to complete the adventure scene.</p>
                <p>If you like this sport and want to practice it in incredible landscapes, with
                    all the support of certified and specialized tourism agencies, see the list with the ideal places
                    for whitewater</p>

                <h2>Do you want to know?</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-1">There are several people on board the same vessel, who must row and guide it
                    following the instructions of the instructor who will also be on the boat.</p>
                <p>It is a great sport to strengthen relationships, since it takes unity, solidarity
                    and a lot of teamwork. As it is an extreme sport, it is mandatory to board with life jackets and
                    helmets.</p>
                <p>One of the objectives of this practice is to pass through the obstacles existing in the
                    path, such as rocks, rapids, whirlpools, waterfalls, small and large waves, depending on the
                    river.</p>
                <p>The level of difficulty will depend on the experience of the practitioners.
                    With beginners, it is best to descend into a calmer river with few obstacles. Those with more
                    experience
                    choose more challenging places, with several rocks and waterfalls.</p>

                <h2>A little bit of whitewater, history and curiosities.</h2>
                <p>A little bit of whitewater, history and curiosities. It was prepared by the well-known
                    John Wesley Powel. The expeditionary organized a journey down the Colorado River, in the United
                    States,
                    in 1869, cataloged as the first record of whitewater descent in the world!</p>
                <p>The boats for the practice at the time were made of wood, with central oars.
                    Still in the USA, in 1936, hard wooden boats began to be replaced by inflatables.</p>
                <p>In 1980 the “self bailer” boats appeared, made of a more resistant and lighter
                    material. Whitewater has expanded and gained more fans. From the IRF (International Whitewater
                    Federation),
                    the first world championship was held in 1999 in South Africa.</p>
                <p>Whitewater, like all extreme sports, also has its risks. It is a combination of
                    fear and emotion of going down rapids for the pleasure of being in full contact with adventure in
                    nature.
                    To get to the place of descent it is essential to have the required safety equipment and be careful
                    not
                    to slip on the wet rocks that give access to the place of descent.</p>
